# MPI Statistical Analysis

## Overview

This program performs parallel computation of the mean, variance, and standard deviation of an array of integers using MPI (Message Passing Interface). It distributes the data across multiple processes, computes local statistics, and aggregates the results to obtain the final values.

## Features

- **Parallel Computation:** Utilizes MPI to distribute the workload and perform calculations concurrently.
- **Dynamic Input:** Users can input the size of the array and its elements interactively.
- **Statistical Measures:** Computes mean, variance, and standard deviation of the array elements.
